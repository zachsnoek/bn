# bn

## Description

A command line tool to help me structure my book notes.

## Installation

```bash
$ sudo npm i -g .
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a new directory to store book notes in

```bash
$ mkdir my-notes
$ cd my-notes
```

2. Initialize a bn project in the directory

```bash
$ bn init
```

3. Add a book to start taking notes for

```bash
$ bn new
```

Once you answer the prompts, there should be a `notes.md` file for the book that can be used to store notes in.

## Kindle Notes Sync

This feature isn't implemented yet but will provide a simple way to create a Markdown file from Kindle notes.
